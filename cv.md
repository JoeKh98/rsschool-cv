## About me:

My name is Joe, im 24 years old. I graduated from Hangzhou Dianzi University studied at the Faculty of Computer Science and Technologies (3.62 GPA). During the last year at University, I actively began to learn the skills necessary for game development. I wanted to understand how each link in GameDev works, so I went beyond learning programming and also studied **Level Design, 3D Modeling, Skinning, Texturing, Animation etc** trying to create everything from scratch. 

After graduation I started to get interesting offers from GameDev companies, so I got an offer from the company where I worked for 1 year. This job only increased my love for making games, but the interest associated with what is behind the **"invisible wall"** of GameDev was also present. 

I like to see the result of what I do, write code and at the end enjoy the view of the result of doing something, the result of which will be visible, thats why I became interested in the profession of Frontend Developer.

I do know that my love of knowledge will lead me through all the circles of Hell to my cherished goal, to become a Frontend Developer **:)**
